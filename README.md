# Georgian Wine Quiz App 🍷🇬🇪

A simple, mobile-first quiz app introducing users to the rich wine culture of Georgia — the cradle of winemaking.

## Purpose

This project was built as part of our first individual coding assignment at Spiced Academy Web Dev Bootcamp. The goal was to create a small, interactive web app using HTML and CSS only (no JavaScript yet), with three sections: Home, Bookmarks and Profile.

## Features

- Interactive quiz cards (click to reveal answers) including Bookmark feauture
- Responsive layout, mobile-first design
- Accessible with semantic HTML and ARIA attributes
- Thematic focus on Georgian wine history and regions
- Personal inspiration from my travels and love for Georgian culture

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS (Flexbox)

## Next Steps

- Add interactivity with JavaScript (toggle answer/bookmark)

## Future Ideas

- Add multiple choice answers and score tracking
- Expand wine questions database: Bookmark wines you liked and enable Profile to show user info or wine preferences
- Collaborate with my favorite Georgian wine bar in Berlin (8000 Vintages)
- Expand it into: A wine discovery app / Map of Georgian wine regions / Integration with 8000 Vintages’ real selection / “Build your own tasting” quiz
